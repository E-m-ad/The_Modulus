# The_Modulus
# illustrate modulus  
# first we let's go about divsion quickly : 
# let's do several test cases , 
# 10 / 5 : How many meaning that line can carry ? 
first and what we need  : how many number 5 accur in number 10 ? 
10 / 5 = 2 ; 10 have a 2 complete cycle for 5 
how to know there is remainder in 10 or not ? 
okay we get 2 from the expression , let's multiple 2 by 5 to know the number of complete units of 5 
2 * 5 = 10 , we get number 10 ;
now we can know is there is remainder from the original digit or not 
the original digit (10) - the number of complete units(2 * 5) = 0 . 
that what the remainder do :) 
10 % 5 = 0 
let go more in example : 
13 % 5 
get the complete cycle of 5 in 13 
got 2 , mulitple 2 by 5 : 10
the original digit (13) - the complete cycle (10) = 3 
same as 13 % 5 = 3 ,
that's how remainder go :)
26 / 5 , also we can distrbute the expression to make it more simple to get the remainder like that : 26 we can do it 25 + 1 
and then (25 + 1) / 5 which give us 25 / 5 + 1 / 5 , 25 / 5 ; 
the remainder above is the 1 / 5 and so on that's is the remainder 
how the modulus can help us in several proplem ? 
[1] - we can check the number is even or odd 
[2] - need to go on specfic cycle of number like : n % m = k , here n must be less than  k 
[3] - we can need modulus 10 to get the last digit in specfice number and when we go with more zeros we go with more digit to left : % 10 get the last one , % 100 get the last two and so on .
[4] - check the divisblty of number over number if give zero is divible otherwise not :)
