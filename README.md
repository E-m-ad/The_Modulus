 # The_Modulus
first we let's go about divsion quickly : <br/>
let's do several test cases , <br/>
10 / 5 : How many meaning that line can carry ? <br/>
first and what we need  : how many number 5 accur in number 10 ? <br/>
10 / 5 = 2 ; 10 have a 2 complete cycle for 5 <br/>
how to know there is remainder in 10 or not ? <br/>
okay we get 2 from the expression , let's multiple 2 by 5 to know the number of complete units of 5 <br/>
2 * 5 = 10 , we get number 10 ;<br/>
now we can know is there is remainder from the original digit or not <br/>
the original digit (10) - the number of complete units(2 * 5) = 0 . <br/>
that what the remainder do :) <br/>
10 % 5 = 0 <br/>
let go more in example : <br/>
13 % 5 <br/>
get the complete cycle of 5 in 13 <br/>
got 2 , mulitple 2 by 5 : 10<br/>
the original digit (13) - the complete cycle (10) = 3 <br/>
same as 13 % 5 = 3 ,<br/>
that's how remainder go :)<br/>
26 / 5 , also we can distrbute the expression to make it more simple to get the remainder like that : 26 we can do it 25 + 1 <br/>
and then (25 + 1) / 5 which give us 25 / 5 + 1 / 5 , 25 / 5 ; <br/>
the remainder above is the 1 / 5 and so on that's is the remainder <br/>
how the modulus can help us in several proplem ? <br/>
[1] - we can check the number is even or odd <br/>
[2] - need to go on specfic cycle of number like : n % m = k , here n must be less than  k <br/>
[3] - we can need modulus 10 to get the last digit in specfice number and when we go with more zeros we go with more digit to left : % 10 get the last one , % 100 get the last two and so on .<br/>
[4] - check the divisblty of number over number if give zero is divible otherwise not :)          <br/>

                                                                                      لتذكرة نفسىى ولعل أحد يستفاد منها وهذا فضل من اللة ثم علم بشمهندس مصطفى سعد
